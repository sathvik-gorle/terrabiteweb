## üéØ Before Launch (Critical)

### 1. Generate PDF Documentation

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Time:** 4-8 hours

Create these 7 PDFs and place in `/public/resources/`:

1. ‚ú≥Ô∏è **numbers-methodology.pdf** - Formulas, assumptions, calculations
2. ‚ú≥Ô∏è **step-4-calculating-tam.pdf** - Market analysis
3. ‚ú≥Ô∏è **terrabite-numbers-page.pdf** - Financial model
4. ‚ú≥Ô∏è **quantified-value-proposition.pdf** - Value breakdown
5. ‚ú≥Ô∏è **carbon-credits-verification.pdf** - MRV process
6. ‚ú≥Ô∏è **concrete-production.pdf** - Technical primer
7. ‚ú≥Ô∏è **expanded-pitch-deck.pdf** - 10-slide deck

**See:** `PDF_CONTENT_TEMPLATES.md` for detailed templates

**Quick Start:**
- Use Google Docs/Slides for drafts
- Export as PDF (< 5MB each)
- Add terrabitenc.com footer to each page
- Optimize images before exporting

### 2. Create Social Media Images

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Time:** 1-2 hours

Create and place in `/public/`:

1. ‚ú≥Ô∏è **og-image.jpg** (1200√ó630px)
   - OpenGraph image for Facebook, LinkedIn
   - Show: Logo + key metric (1.53 tCO‚ÇÇe locked) + tagline
   
2. ‚ú≥Ô∏è **twitter-image.jpg** (1200√ó630px)
   - Twitter card image
   - Similar design to og-image

**Tools:**
- Canva (easy templates)
- Figma (professional design)
- Adobe Photoshop

### 3. Update Contact Information

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Time:** 5 minutes

Verify/update in these files:

1. `/src/sections/ContactRFQ.tsx`
   - Phone number (currently: 919-555-1234)
   - Email addresses

2. `/src/sections/Footer.tsx`
   - Phone number
   - Email addresses

grep -r "info@terrabitenc.com" src/
```

### 4. Set Up Form Backend

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Time:** 30 minutes

Quote form in `ContactRFQ.tsx` needs a backend. Choose one:

**Option A: Formspree (Easiest)**
```typescript
// In ContactRFQ.tsx, update handleSubmit:
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

**Option B: Netlify Forms**
```typescript
<form name="contact" netlify>
```

**Option C: Custom API**

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Start with Minimum Viable PDFs
Don't wait for perfect PDFs. Create simplified versions:
- Use Google Docs templates
- Include key formulas and assumptions
- Add "Version 1.0 - To be updated quarterly" note
- Launch with these, refine over time

### 2. Gradual Content Refinement
- Launch with current data (31,000 lb, 1.53 tCO‚ÇÇe)
- Update metrics monthly as projects complete
- Add new case studies as they finish
- Iterate based on user feedback

### 3. Monitor Form Submissions
- Set up email notifications for new quotes
- Respond within 24 hours (as promised on site)
- Track conversion rate (visitors ‚Üí quote requests)
- Ask submitters how they found you

### 4. Leverage Analytics
Even without Google Analytics, you can:
- Check Vercel Analytics (built-in)
- Monitor Google Search Console for search queries
- Track email inquiries to see what people ask
