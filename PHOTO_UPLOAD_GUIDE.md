## üîß How to Update After Uploading

Once you've saved all 8 photos to `/src/assets/images/pilot/`, update `src/sections/PilotGallery.tsx`:

1. Add these imports at the top:
```tsx
import entrepreneurshipFairPresentation from "@/assets/images/pilot/entrepreneurship-fair-presentation.jpg";
import entrepreneurshipFairTeam from "@/assets/images/pilot/entrepreneurship-fair-team.jpg";
import charlottePour1 from "@/assets/images/pilot/charlotte-pilot-pour-1.jpg";
import charlottePour2 from "@/assets/images/pilot/charlotte-pilot-pour-2.jpg";
import charlottePour3 from "@/assets/images/pilot/charlotte-pilot-pour-3.jpg";
import charlottePour4 from "@/assets/images/pilot/charlotte-pilot-pour-4.jpg";
import launchChapelHill from "@/assets/images/pilot/launch-chapel-hill-presentation.jpg";
import firstBatch from "@/assets/images/pilot/first-batch-concrete.jpg";
```

2. Update the `pilotImages` array to use these imports:
```tsx
const pilotImages: PilotImage[] = [
  {
    src: entrepreneurshipFairPresentation,
    alt: "Entrepreneurship Fair at NCSSM",
    caption: "Entrepreneurship Fair at NCSSM - Presenting Terrabite's biochar concrete concept",
    link: "https://entrepreneurship.ncssm.edu/home/e-ship-fair",
  },
  {
    src: entrepreneurshipFairTeam,
    alt: "Entrepreneurship Fair Team",
    caption: "Entrepreneurship Fair - Team showcasing biochar concrete samples",
  },
  // ... and so on for all 8 images
];
```

3. Remove the `unoptimized` prop from the Image components (Next.js will automatically optimize local images)
